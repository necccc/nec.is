<Intro>

  Almost every Node.js developer saw the joke of the huge node_modules folder tearing hole in the space-time continuum, but how many thought of what could be done to prevent this?

  By fine-tuning our npm publishing workflow, we can save time, bandwidth and money for others, so let’s learn more about it! I’ll shed some light on how the npm module authoring works, and show some best practices on how we do npm authoring at our company.

It was a pleasure to speak at NodeConf EU in 2018 at the Lyrath Estate in Kilkenny, Ireland. The 3 day, single track conference balances great between sessions and workshops, giving us hands-on knowledge on various topics, like Node.js core contributions, GraphQL, WebAssembly, diagnosing issues in Node apps and many more.
