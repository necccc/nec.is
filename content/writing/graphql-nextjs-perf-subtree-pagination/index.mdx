<Intro>

In some previous posts I've [introduced](/writing/graphql-with-next-js-and-apollo/) Next.js and GraphQL a bit, then showed some tips on [creating and paginating lists](/writing/next-js-apollo-graphql-performance-tuning-lists-pagination/), and quickly explained how to [load detailed data from lists, looking as instant as possible, using cache](/writing/next-js-apollo-graphql-performance-tuning-from-lists-to-details/).

In this post we're still looking at a detailed view of some resource, but lets say one of the properties is an array of **other** resources, for example members of a race or a faction in Star Wars!

</Intro>


this was the toughest, but if we stick to familiar react best practices, like hoisting state, it's clear

lets say we have some related data on details page, that is huge and would take several seconds to resolve for the graphql server
paginate subtree in schema
ask the first page only
fetch data later, if needed


details fetch only the first page of related data, render when ready
compose the component rendering the related info with it's own query for paginated relating data
put related pagination data to detail page state
at first render, skip the relating query, since we already have the data
the related component should not update it's own state for next page, lets hoist that data up to the details page state
the button now updates the state in the parent component
on state change, flip the skip flag, update the page metadata, and let the related query run



## Subtree Pagination

We should not query every member of the Rebel Alliance for this page, only the first ten maybe, and let the user browse them later. Displaying so much data on a single page wouldn't be just weird UX, but resolving all those members might take several seconds for our GraphQL server.

In classical REST such lists are just URLs, pointing each to the listed resource items - so if we would like to resolve a property in GraphQL, that has a list of a 100 items, that would mean a 100 new query for our resolvers on the GraphQL server.
_(Note: In these examples our GraphQL server resolves Types and fields from a REST API backend, not from a database directly)_

### Define the Schema

We can tell the GraphQL server to resolve the first 10 only, and use some paging parameters to fetch more items later. Lets see this on the Species type in our Star Wars Schema!

`gist:529272f6ce6742cfecdee708eff271d6#species.graphql`

Our first query can run without any parameters, because it will use the default values. Later we can fetch this field only, updating the paging parameters.

We render our detail page using the cache if possible, as explained in the [previous post](). We add a button, to "Show More" members of a Species, this button should update the paging parameters of the query. But here, we have our first problem: updating the query parameters for this detail page, would fetch _all_ the data in the query _again_, and that is one thing GraphQL is intented to avoid.

To solve this, we create a small component with the list of the members, and the button (and if we're crafty enough, we can reuse this list on other detail pages)! Notable props this component will receive are:

 - **id**, to know which species we're looking at
 - **pageData**, with all the data needed to configure the `people` field, seen above in the Schema
 - **data**, the actual list of people
 - **onLoadMore**, a function to call, to init the query for the next page of people
 - **skip**, this prop indicates if the component should skip fetching data, since it's getting it from the parent component of first load

`gist:529272f6ce6742cfecdee708eff271d6#RelatedPeople.jsx`

Now we can use this component on our detail page!

`gist:529272f6ce6742cfecdee708eff271d6#SpeciesDetails.js`


Note the full query, we include the field `people`, with their id, name and picture only.

At first render, the query receives no parameters related to paging the `people` field, and there is no need for those, since the Schema has default values.

I've tried to explain all this on a few slides, see them here:
