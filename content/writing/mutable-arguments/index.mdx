<Intro>

I've found this weird behavior of the `arguments` inside a function while playing and experimenting with some code some days ago.
Normally it would not be interesting since all the code we use is usually built-transpiled and put into strict mode,
but my sandbox was not - and this is an exact case when omitting strict mode can cause weird side effects.

</Intro>

## Arguments

Lets start with the famous `arguments` object found in almost<sup class="sidenote" title="Fat arrow functions are scoped lexically and do not have their own arguments variable">*</sup>
every function in JavaScript.

Quickly go over what you can and cannot do with `arguments`.

You can

- access the passed arguments using a zero-based index
- access its length
- use it with the spread operator
- completely overwrite it in non-strict mode
- iterate over it using for-of
- update values in it, using indexes
- attach static methods and properties on it

You cannot

- use array methods on it
- add new items
- remove items from it

Looks pretty clear, right? Now, let's get down the rabbit hole...

## Tracking and mutating

Focus on our mutable arguments object right now. Take a look at this piece of code,
and try to guess what is written to the console:


`gist:84225415896af12d1be18d18db54d413#param_reassign.js`


Just by looking at the code, we think it should log **2**. But here comes the strange quirk, it will log **"foo"**.
If you don't believe me, [try it out yourself](https://jsbin.com/bojirab/1/edit?js,console).

What just happened?! Turns out there is a maintained relationship between the arguments of a function,
and the arguments object, when certain conditions apply:

<Blockquote
  by="Mozilla Developer Network"
  link="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/arguments#Rest_default_and_destructured_parameters"
  linkText="Arguments tracking the arguments object"
>
  When a non-strict function does not contain rest, default, or destructured parameters,
  then the values in the arguments object do track the values of the arguments (and vice versa).
</Blockquote>

This works vice-versa, altering either the named argument or an entry in the arguments object,
will track the changes to the other one:


`gist:84225415896af12d1be18d18db54d413#arguments_relationship.js`


Using strict mode, or working with rest, defaults or destructured arguments will prevent this weird behavior


`gist:84225415896af12d1be18d18db54d413#arguments_relationship-strict_mode.js`


Check out these examples as real code [in this bin](https://jsbin.com/zoyicoh/5/edit?js,console).

Quirks like this can cause side effects, and severe bugs later in your code, so be safe! The following tricks can help you, to keep your code sane:

- use strict mode whenever possible, not just in your compiled, authored code
- use ESLint, with rules like [no-param-reassign](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/no-param-reassign)

**PS:** this is totally different, when you assign an argument entry to a variable _inside_ the function, like here


`gist:84225415896af12d1be18d18db54d413#param_assignment.js`
